1. Welcome and Meeting Purpose
    • The meeting was called to order at 2:00 PM by James Harrington. 
    • Purpose: Review and approve proposed vulnerability remediations for the server team. 

2. Discussion Items
a. Proposed Vulnerability Remediations

b. Technical Overview
    • Michael Lee: Deferred the explanation to James Harrington, who developed the solution. 
    • James Harrington: Provided a detailed explanation: 
        1. Insecure Protocols and Cipher Suites: These allow systems to negotiate outdated, deprecated algorithms and protocols, posing security risks. 
        2. Solution: A PowerShell script was developed to disable insecure protocols and ciphers and enable secure, standardized ones via Windows registry updates. 
c. Rollback Plan
    • Joe Smith: Asked about contingency plans if issues arise. 
    • James Harrington: Explained the tiered deployment strategy: 
        1. Deployment Phases: Pilot group (small set of systems), pre-production, and full production.
