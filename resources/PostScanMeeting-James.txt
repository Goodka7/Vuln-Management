Date: January 22, 2024
Time: 9:00 AM - 10:00 AM
Location: Microsoft Teams
Attendees:

1. Welcome and Meeting Purpose
    • The meeting was called to order at 9:00 AM by James Harrington. 
    • Purpose: Review the results of the initial discovery scan and discuss next steps for remediation. 

2. Discussion Items
a. Scan Results Overview
    • James Harrington: Inquired about any issues during the scan. 
        • Joe Smith: Reported no outages or resource overutilization; the scan ran smoothly and was minimally intrusive. 
    • James Harrington: Confirmed the positive outcome and noted continued monitoring would ensure smooth operations during future scans. 
b. Key Vulnerability Findings
    • James Harrington shared the primary vulnerabilities identified: 
        1. Wireshark: Found installed on multiple servers and is significantly out of date. 
        2. Local Guest Account: Discovered as a member of the local administrators group, requiring removal. 
        3. Deprecated Protocols: Medium strength cipher suites, TLS 1.1, and TLS 1.0 are deprecated and need remediation. 
        4. Windows Updates: Certain vulnerabilities may be automatically resolved by regular patching, such as those related to Microsoft Edge Chromium. 
        5. Self-Signed Certificates: Identified but deemed low-priority as they are standard computer self-signed certificates. 
c. Remediation Strategies
    • Joe Smith: Mentioned that most servers appear to have uniform vulnerabilities, simplifying remediation efforts. 
    • James Harrington: Proposed initial remediation steps: 
        1. Uninstall outdated Wireshark software. 
        2. Remove the guest account from the local administrators group. 
        3. Address deprecated cipher suites and protocols through the Change Control Board (CCB). 
        4. Ensure Windows updates are applied regularly via existing patch management processes. 
    • Joe Smith: Confirmed no anticipated issues with the remediation process. Uninstalling Wireshark and fixing the guest account should be straightforward tasks. 
d. Patch Management
    • James Harrington: Asked about patch management for Windows Update-related vulnerabilities. 
    • Joe Smith: Confirmed that a patch management system is in place and updates are handled automatically, with completion expected by next week. 

3. Decisions Made
    • Continue monitoring resource utilization during scans. 
    • Prioritize remediation of Wireshark, guest account issues, and deprecated protocols. 
    • Utilize Change Control Board for approval of major changes. 
    • Allow patch management to handle Windows update-related vulnerabilities.
