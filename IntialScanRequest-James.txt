1. Welcome and Meeting Purpose
    • The meeting was called to order at 3:00 PM by James Harrington. 
    • Purpose: Discuss and obtain necessary permissions to conduct the initial vulnerability scan across the organization’s servers. 

2. Discussion Items
a. Scope of the Vulnerability Scan
    • James Harrington: Provided an overview of the scan, including: 
        • Target systems: All production servers. 
        • Tools: Use of approved vulnerability scanning software. 
        • Frequency: Initial scan to establish a baseline. 
    • James Harrington: Explained that the scans will take approximately 4-6 hours and will require administrative credentials to execute. 
b. Impact on Server Operations
    • Joe Smith: Raised concerns about potential disruptions during the scan, resource utilization, and granting administrative credentials for all 200 machines. 
        • James Harrington: Explained how the scanning process works, highlighting: 
            • The scan checks for vulnerabilities by analyzing system configurations, software versions, and known exploits. 
            • Administrative credentials are needed to access system-level data essential for comprehensive scanning. 
        • Suggested conducting an initial scan on one machine to monitor resource usage and validate the process. 
c. Permissions for Execution
    • James Harrington: Requested formal approval to proceed with the scan. 
    • Joe Smith: Agreed to provide the necessary permissions under the condition that a trial scan is conducted first on a single machine. 
d. Follow-Up Steps
    • Develop a communication plan for stakeholders. 
    • Conduct a trial scan on one non-critical system to validate the process and monitor resources. 

3. Decisions Made
    • Permission granted for the initial vulnerability scan, pending successful completion of a trial scan. 
    • Scans to be scheduled during low-traffic periods. 
    • Initial scan to be performed on one machine for monitoring.
